# Blinky -> Heart Rate Coding Challnege

The goal of this project is to take the [Android-nRF-Blinky](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Blinky) application from [NordicSemiconductor](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor) and introduce the functionality of displaying heart rate data sent from a Nordic [nRF52 DevKit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52-DK). The heart rate data comes from a pre-built demo application loaded on the DevKit.
